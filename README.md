## Changes
### 2018-03-08
* (expertmm) release on GitHub, added viable license
### 2013-08-04
* (LionsDen) forked <https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?p=103856#p103856> and released version 2.1
* Miner checks for air, water or lava under it's current level to mine.
  When mining, torches are placed (hopefully) on a wall so they
  don't fall when disturbed unless you mine the node they are
  attached to. Ladders show up in the direction that the miner is
  facing.
